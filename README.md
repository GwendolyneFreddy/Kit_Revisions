# Kit_Revisions
Kit Revisions aims to rebalance and tweak the classes and kits available in the Baldur's Gate II engine. Notable priorities include making all kit choices equally interesting, providing unkitted characters with similar capabilities to kitted ones, ensuring that kits are effectively balanced in Tutu and BGT, and expanding upon the concepts behind individual kits and classes.
